<p>This page is an attempt to bring together information about the Fiscal Futures Project in one place. For me, it’s difficult to understand the project because it feels so large and the information seems scattered across many places (though maybe it isn’t, really).</p>
<section id="methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<section id="all-funds-approach" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="all-funds-approach">All Funds Approach</h3>
<ul>
<li>FF transforms the data from the Illinois Office of Comptroller (IOC) to provide accurate time-series data.</li>
<li>FF adopts an&nbsp;<strong>All Funds&nbsp;approach</strong>, which tracks revenues and expenditures by the functions of Illinois State Government in order to address inconsistency from the <em>General Fund approach</em>
<ul>
<li>The concept of <em>General Fund</em> is used by the IOC and political discussion, but it is not consistent over time.
<ul>
<li>For example, money for a specific program may come from one fund in a given year, but the source may change to another fund in the next year.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[!All funds by SAMS manual]- - <strong>General Funds</strong>: Those funds established to receive the major portion of tax revenues and to pay the regular operating and administrative expenses of most State agencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;[!General Funds (15 ILCS 20/50-40)]- 
&gt;&gt;&nbsp;"General funds" or "State general funds" means the General Revenue Fund, the Common School Fund, the General Revenue Common School Special Account Fund, the Education Assistance Fund, the Fund for the Advancement of Education, the Commitment to Human Services Fund, and the Budget Stabilization Fund.  </code></pre>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ul>
<li><strong>Highway Funds</strong>: Those funds established to receive and distribute special assessments related to transportation, such as Motor Fuel Tax, and to support the construction and maintenance of transportation facilities and activities of the State of Illinois.</li>
<li><strong>Special State Funds</strong>: Those funds designated in Section 5 of the Finance Act as special funds in the State Treasury and not elsewhere classified. They represent a segregation of accounts for specific purposes on a substantially perpetual basis.</li>
<li><strong>Bond Financed Funds</strong>: Those funds established to receive and administer the proceeds of various bond issues of the State.</li>
<li><strong>Debt Service Funds</strong>: Those funds established to finance and account for the payment of principal redemption and interest associated with the general obligation bond issues of the State.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Trust Funds</strong>: Those funds established pursuant to grants and contracts between State agencies and the United States. The funds are administered for specific purposes established by the terms of the grants and contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Revolving Funds</strong>: Those funds established to finance and account for intra-governmental services. Appropriation of resources of these funds is dependent upon intra-governmental service requirements and appropriations of other State agencies. Revolving Fund resources are provided by expenditures of State agencies financed by the fund.</li>
<li><strong>State Trust Funds</strong>: Those funds established by statute or under statutory authority for specific purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Other Trust Funds</strong>: Those funds established to receive and account for resources for subsequent disbursement to a designated recipient. Escrow funds are an example of an Other Trust Fund. &gt; In the FF dataset, <code>University Income</code> is the only fund for Other Trust Funds in FY2026</li>
</ul>

<section id="inclusion-exclusion-criteria" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inclusion-exclusion-criteria">Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria</h5>
<p>Most of appropriated funds<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> are included and non-appropriated funds<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> are excluded. However, there are some exceptions following criteria: ###### Inclusion 1. Non-appropriated funds collects a state-levied tax for state functions 2. Non-appropriated funds that supports a state function - Some non-appropriated funds support state functions such as education, social services, transportation, public facilities, regulation, natural resources, and law enforcement. - Generally, these are federal trust funds for a specified state project or purpose - Federal money are counted as revenue, it would be inconsistent if these funds would not included. 3. Non-appropriated funds collects a user fee that supports state functions - e.g.) Illinois State Toll Highway Revenue Fund, which collects tolls and supports the maintenance of Illinois toll roads.</p>
<section id="exclusion" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exclusion">Exclusion</h6>
<ol type="1">
<li>The funds that Illinois state solely collects for local taxing body</li>
<li>The funds that hold monies for individuals, not the state
<ul>
<li>e.g.) child support collection funds or employee pension own-contribution funds</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The fund’s expenditure or revenues have been counted elsewhere (i.e., avoid double-counting)
<ul>
<li>e.g.) Commercial consolidation fund distributes state benefit payments to individuals, service providers, and local governments by direct deposit. The revenues to this fund is included, but expenditures from this fund are not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The fund holds designated user fees targeted for a specific purpose that is not a public function.
<ul>
<li>e.g.) fund 0098 collects fees from harness race entrants and pays them out to race winners.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The funds that are dead or lack clear information
<ul>
<li>These funds are generally appear to be very small.</li>
<li>Because we are projecting forward from the most recently completed fiscal year, we assumed that these funds would not be in the frame.</li>

<p>Usually, the raw data from the IOC is inconsistent with past years. Therefore, make sure that the data consistency, through the following process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Check any new agencies, re-used funds, etc.

<li>Create a list of funds, fund names, agencies, etc. for comparison between new year and prior year to identify new funds.</li>

<li>Update <code>funds_ab_in.xlsx</code>
<ul>
<li><code>funds_ab_in.xlsx</code> shows the use of funds.</li>
<li>Use criteria to determine if the new funds should be in or out of the all-funds frame.</li>

<li>Change the variable names to consistent with other files
