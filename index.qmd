# Introduction {#introduction}

-   FF transforms the data from the IOC to provide accurate time-series data.
    -   The Illinois Office of Comptroller (IOC) and political discussion use the concept of General Fund but it is not consistent over time.
        -   For example, money for a specific program may come from one fund in a given year, but the source may change to another fund in the next year.
    -   To address this inconsistency, FF adopts an **All Funds** approach, which tracks revenues and expenditures by the functions of Illinois State Government.

# Requesting Data from the IOC {#requesting-data-from-the-ioc}

-   FF uses data from the IOC, obtained through the IOC’s Freedom of Information Officer (FOIA).
-   An RA has to request data after the lapse period ends
    -   Template for request: *==Link will be added==*
    -   Check that lapse period is fully ended
        -   the lapse period ended on August 31, but may remain opened for error corrections and late billings.
        -   Generally, revenue data is complete earlier than expenditure
-   Data is separated into **Expenditure** and **Revenue** in MS-Excel files

# Data Wrangling {#data-wrangling}

## Related Files {#related-files}

-   Raw data
    -   **`allrevfiles.xlsx`**, **`allexpfiles.xlsx`** : Raw data from IOC

    -   [**`funds_ab_in.xlsx`**](Manual_Draft#%5Edd03d9): Funds information used since 1998, created from FF

        -   contains all funds that have existed, their current status of existence, whether their numbers have been reused different purposes, and the new fund numbers each year by the IOC.

    -   **`ioc_source_type.xlsx`** : Source type information, created from FF
-   Intermediate Outputs
    -   `rev_allyears.csv`, `exp_allyears.csv`
        -   initial combined data files, merged with `funds_ab_in.xlsx`, and `ioc_source_type.xlsx`
        -   Cleaned version of data before aggregating totals or dropping observations not included in the FF fiscal gap calculation.
            -   Contain all years in one file.
            -   Funds and agencies should have numbers and consistent labels.
            -   Includes the “Group” variable used in the FF Annual Report used for calculating expenditures by function. 
    -   `rev_temp.csv`, `exp_temp.csv`: Data prepared for the FF annual report
        -   Data is cleaned and coded up to the point right before aggregating category totals.
        -   Drops observations we do not keep in fiscal gap calculation.
-   ~~Final outputs~~
    -   ~~`summary_file_FY20XX.xlsx`~~

## Data Processing {#data-processing}

#### `allexpfiles.csv`, `allrevfile.csv`

-   The first task is to make data consistent with the previous data.
    -   The FOIA of IOC send the expenditure and revenue data as excel files.

1.  Change the variable names to be consistent with other files.
    -   They seem to change almost every year in the file received from the FOIA
    -   For example:
        -   `AGENCYNAME` --\> `agency_name`
2.  Once variable names are shared over all years of data, combine past years with newest year.
    -   Bind all past years and the current year together in one dataframe
    -   Save the data file as a csv file in its Revenue/Expenditure file
        -   When adding new fiscal years, put the the newest year of data for revenue and expenditures in their respective folders.
            -   All revenue files are in a \`revenue\` folder that I reference when I set the working directory.

    -   "\# Gathering and Cleaning Data! {#sec-gathering-and-cleaning-data}" in code-cleaning.qmd

### `funds_ab_in.xlsx`

\^dd03d9

-   General steps:
    1.  Identify new funds and agencies and reused funds for newest fiscal year.
        -   Create a list of funds, agencies, fund names, etc. for the new year from the raw files (i.e., `allexpfiles.xlsx`, `allrevfiles.xlsx`)
        -   Identify new funds by comparing the list to the immediate prior year.
    2.  Recode funds to take into account different fund numbers/names over the years.
        -   Use criteria to determine if the new funds should be in or out of the all-funds frame.
        -   See \[Recoding New and Reused Funds\] for code chunk that does this.\
    3.  Update `inputs/funds_ab_in.xlsx` with any changes from previous fiscal year.

    -   "\### Recoding New and Reused Funds" in code-cleaning.qmd

### `rev_temp.csv` & `exp_temp.csv`

-   the initial combined and years of data are saved as dataframes named `exp_allyears` and `rev_allyears`.
    -   These are then saved as exp_temp and rev_temp while recoding variables.
    -   This is BEFORE creating Fiscal Future category groups and further data cleaning done in the Calculating the Fiscal Gap page.
-   For aggregating revenue, use the `rev_allyears` file, join the `funds_ab_in` file to it, and then join the `ioc_source_type` file.
    -   Remember: You need to update the `funds_ab_in` and `ioc_source_type` file every year!
-   The `exp_temp.csv` file and `rev_temp.csv` file are most likely the data that non-Fiscal Future researchers would want to use for their own analyses. These files should have consistent agencies and funds tracked from 1998 to the present.

## Category recoding {#category-recoding}

### `exp_temp.csv`

-   Aggregate expenditures

#### Tax Refund {#tax-refund}

Save tax refunds as negative revenue. - Code refunds to match the rev_type codes: - 02 = income taxes - fund == "0278" & sequence == "00" - fund == "0278" & sequence == "02" - 03 = corporate income taxes - fund == "0278" & sequence == "01" - 06 = sales tax - obj_seq_type == "99250055" - 09 = motor fuel tax - 21= Inheritance tax - object 9921 - 24 = insurance taxes and fees - fund == "0378" & object == "9925" - 35 = all other tax refunds - fund == "0001" & object == "9925"
